# Experiment 3 – Deployment & Web Application Containerization

This experiment is divided into two parts:

- **Part 1 (P1)** – Deploying NGINX using different base images and comparing image layers.
- **Part 2 (WebApp)** – Containerizing a Python Flask web application.

This part includes:

- Deploying official NGINX image  
- Building custom NGINX image using **Ubuntu base**  
- Building custom NGINX image using **Alpine base**  
- Comparing image sizes and layers
